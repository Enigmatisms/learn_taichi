# Path Tracing with Taichi-Lang

---

The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of path tracing algorithm, especially Monte-Carlo integral (used in CG). Since in general, Python - Taichi is way more efficient than C++/CUDA, with which I won't be able to develop fast...

- [ ] Step1: wavefront object parsing
- [ ] Step2: Rasterizer: mesh visualization
- [ ] Step3: Coordinate transformation (change of view / object pose)
- [ ] Step4: Basic types and fundamental knowledge for Monte-Carlo integral. My goal is not to build the program which can only trace light (how it bounces, not being able to "integrate" anything)
