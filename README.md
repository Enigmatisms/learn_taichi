### Taichi Learning Phase 1

- Basic syntax and usage, being able to create some parallel visualized programs. Note that only one case will not be enough, therefore you can try to build more simple programs.
  - [x] SDF (DF) visualizer
  - [x] Marching squares
  - [x] Cellular automata (simple playable one)
  - [x] Flocking simulation (complex compared to the first three)

- Take a look at some examples will be good, too. Get inspired by others.
