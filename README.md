### Taichi Learning Week 1 Goal

- Basic syntax and usage, being able to create some parallel visualized programs. Note that only one case will not be enough, therefore you can try to build more simple programs.
  - [x] SDF (DF) visualizer
  - [x] Marching squares
  - [ ] Cellular automata (simple playable one)
  - [ ] Multi-body simulation
- Take a look at some examples will be good, too. Get inspired by others.
